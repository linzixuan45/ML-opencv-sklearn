**Intelligent algorithms for building image processing apps using OpenCV 4, Python, and scikit-learn**

## What is this book about?
OpenCV is an opensource library for building computer vision apps. The latest release, OpenCV 4, offers a plethora of features and platform improvements that are covered comprehensively in this up-to-date second edition.

You'll start by understanding the new features and setting up OpenCV 4 to build your computer vision applications. You will explore the fundamentals of machine learning and even learn to design different algorithms that can be used for image processing. Gradually, the book will take you through supervised and unsupervised machine learning. You will gain hands-on experience using scikit-learn in Python for a variety of machine learning applications. Later chapters will focus on different machine learning algorithms, such as a decision tree, support vector machines (SVM), and Bayesian learning, and how they can be used for object detection computer vision operations. You will then delve into deep learning and ensemble learning, and discover their real-world applications, such as handwritten digit classification and gesture recognition. Finally, youâ€™ll get to grips with the latest Intel OpenVINO for building an image processing system.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the core machine learning concepts for image processing
* Explore the theory behind machine learning and deep learning algorithm design
* Discover effective techniques to train your deep learning models
* Evaluate machine learning models to improve the performance of your models
* Integrate algorithms such as support vector machines and Bayes classifier in your computer vision applications
